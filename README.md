1. Creating an Engaging Entertainment Page with Multimedia and CSS
Objective:
This assignment aims to develop a captivating entertainment web page by integrating multimedia elements such as images, audio, and video, alongside creative CSS effects. Students will focus on enhancing links, images, buttons, and forms, leveraging CSS pseudoclasses to add interactivity and visual appeal.

Problem Statement:
In the realm of entertainment, captivating web pages play a vital role in engaging users and providing immersive experiences. This assignment challenges students to create an entertainment page that seamlessly integrates multimedia elements while applying CSS pseudoclasses to enhance links, images, buttons, and forms, ultimately creating an interactive and visually appealing platform for entertainment content.

Task 1: Interactive Navigation Links
Design a navigation bar with interactive links that change appearance on hover. Use CSS pseudoclasses to style the links with hover effects, such as color changes or underlines, to enhance user interaction and visual feedback.

Expected Outcome:
A navigation bar with visually appealing links that change appearance on hover, providing an interactive browsing experience for users.

Task 2: Eye-catching Image Gallery
Create an image gallery showcasing entertainment content, such as movie posters, album covers, or game screenshots. Implement CSS styles to add hover effects to the images, such as adding a border or other style that makes the gallery visually engaging and interactive.

Expected Outcome:
An image gallery where images enlarge or transition smoothly when hovered over, creating an immersive and visually captivating browsing experience for users.

Task 3: Dynamic Call-to-Action Buttons
Integrate call-to-action (CTA) buttons that prompt users to take specific actions, such as "Watch Now," "Listen Here," or "Play Game." Apply CSS pseudoclasses to style the buttons with hover effects, such as color changes or shadows, to make them visually dynamic and inviting.

Expected Outcome:
CTA buttons that transform in appearance when hovered over, encouraging user interaction and prompting them to engage with the entertainment content.

Task 4: Interactive Form for User Feedback
Develop a feedback form where users can provide comments, ratings, or suggestions about the entertainment content. Use CSS pseudoclasses to style form elements, such as text fields and submit buttons, with hover effects or transitions to make the form visually appealing and user-friendly.

Expected Outcome:
A feedback form with stylized form elements that respond visually to user interaction, creating a seamless and engaging experience for submitting feedback.

2. Styling Forms, Lists, and Tables with CSS for Enhanced User Interfaces
Objective:
This assignment aims to deepen understanding and application of CSS in styling form elements, lists, and tables to create user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing. By focusing on these elements, students will learn to enhance the structure and design of web content, improving user experience and interaction.

Problem Statement:
Forms, lists, and tables are fundamental components of web design, serving various purposes from data collection to content organization. However, without proper styling, these elements can appear bland and may not engage users effectively. This challenge involves applying CSS techniques to transform these basic structures into attractive and intuitive interfaces.

Task 1: Styling a User Registration Form
Create an HTML form for user registration that includes fields for name, email, password, and a submit button. Use CSS to style the form elements, focusing on layout, spacing, borders, and hover effects to enhance usability and aesthetics.

Expected Outcome:
A visually appealing registration form with clearly defined input fields, pleasant hover states, and an attractive submit button, encouraging user interaction.

Task 2: Enhancing Lists for Navigation
Implement an unordered list to serve as a navigation menu, including links to Home, About, Services, and Contact pages. Style the list with CSS to create a horizontal menu with custom bullet points or icons, and apply hover effects to the links.

Expected Outcome:
A stylish navigation menu with horizontal layout, custom indicators for list items, and interactive link styles, improving the site's navigational experience.

Task 3: Styling Tables for Data Presentation
Design a table to display data (e.g., a schedule, product list, or statistical information). Apply CSS to improve the readability and visual appeal of the table, focusing on header styles, cell padding, border styles, and alternating row colors.

Expected Outcome:
A well-structured table with enhanced styles that make data easy to read and visually appealing, including highlighted headers, sufficient spacing, and subtle color distinctions between rows.
